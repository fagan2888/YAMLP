This directory contains datasets that have been generated from the electronic structure calculations.

### hackathonData.csv

This file contains a configuration of the system, the pbe energy and the b3lyp energy on each line. The configuration is expressed as C,x,y,z,H,x,y,z,H,x,y,z...
It only contains 7287 data points because it is the dataset that was used during the hackathon. 

### tot-pbe-b3lyp.csv

This file is the same as the hackathonData.csv, but it contains the additional data that was calculated after the hackathon. 

### pbe_b3lyp_partQ.csv

This file contain a configuration of the system, the partial charges calculated at pbe level, the pbe energy and the b3lyp energy on each line. The configuration of the system is expressed as Cx, Cy, Cz, Hx, Hy, Hz...
It contains all the b3lyp datapoints that were generated (17750 data points).
